# FuzzyNetClass

FuzzyNetClass addresses the uncertainties and inaccuracies in the network traffic classification process by exploring Interval-valued Fuzzy Logic to classify network traffic with a focus on streaming video.

FuzzyNetClass was conceived for classifying network traffic to identify video streaming flows. The FuzzyNetClass proposal considers a rule base acting in three stages: Fuzzification, Inference, and Defuzzification, returning as output the classification level of the analyzed network flow, allowing (or not) its identification as a video.
  
The modeling of FuzzyNetClass system was performed using the Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic System Toolbox (IT2FLT) module [[2]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4295341) and Juzzy [[1]](http://juzzy.wagnerweb.net/).

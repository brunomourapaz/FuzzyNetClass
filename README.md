# FuzzyNetClass

FuzzyNetClass was conceived for classifying network traffic to identify video streaming flows. The FuzzyNetClass proposal considers a rule base acting in three stages: Fuzzification, Inference, and Defuzzification, returning as output the classification level of the analyzed network flow, allowing (or not) its identification as a video.
  
The modeling of FuzzyNetClass system was performed using the Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic System Toolbox (IT2FLT) module [XX] and Juzzy[YY].
